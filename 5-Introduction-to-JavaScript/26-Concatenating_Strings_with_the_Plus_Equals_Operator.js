/*I this lesson we learn about using the += operator to concatenate strings together,
this can break a long string into several lines.*/
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
