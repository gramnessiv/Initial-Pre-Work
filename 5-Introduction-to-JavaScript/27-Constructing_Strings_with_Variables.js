/*In this lesson we learn about using other variables in a concatenated string
to make a sentence.*/
// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Charles";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
