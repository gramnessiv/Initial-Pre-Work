/*In this lesson we learn about using the += operator to append variables together.*/
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "Fun!!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
