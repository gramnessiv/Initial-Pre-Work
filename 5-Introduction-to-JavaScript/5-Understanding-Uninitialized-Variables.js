/*In this lesson we learned what happens if an undefined variable is used. If it is
a mathmatical operation  it will result in NaN (Not a Number), and if it is a concatenate
operation it will result with "undefined"*/
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
